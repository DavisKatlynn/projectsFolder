//you will be given an array a and a value x. all you need to do is check weather the privided aray contains the value.
//The type of a and a can be string OR Int.
//Return true if the array contains the value, false if not.
//take note of the wording of this porblem. I should be able to pass in either an array of strings or an array of Ints and it will work the same.

var array: [Int] = [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(array.contains (5))
